# Pokemon Assets Module

## Overview

Installable with this link (through the normal Foundry module interface): `https://github.com/righthandofvecna/pokemon-assets/releases/latest/download/module.json`

This module contains assets for trainers and Pok√©mon, and some sounds. It also adds support for:

- Animated walking spritesheets for tokens
- Token and Tile collisions (tokens can't enter each other's spaces, as if there were walls around the tokens, and tiles can be configured as solid)
- Restricting movement to keyboard-only or disallowing diagonals on a per-scene basis
- Animations and sounds for catching Pok√©mon and taking damage
- Sliding Ice, One-Way Jumps, Trainer's "Eyes Meeting" Animations and movement, Pok√©mon Centers & Computers, and scene-to-scene doors (usable through Foundry v12's "Regions" tool)
- Breakable Boulders (*Rock Smash*), Destructible Plants (*Cut*), Destructible Whirlpools (*Whirlpool*), Movable Boulders (*Strength*), Climbable Rocks (*Rock Climb*), Climbable Waterfalls (*Waterfall*), and the ability to use their corresponding field moves to destroy/move/interact with them
- Tile Scripts, which are scripts that run when the user interacts with a tile. A tool for quickly placing signs is also included.
- Interacting with things like Item Piles with the Enter button (configurable), or opening unlocked doors with Enter
- Isometric Perspective module support
- A more efficient Follow Me! module replacement

## Usage

### Setting Sprites

***Method 1.*** **Setting the Trainer Profile.** You can set the actor's profile to one of the images in `modules/pokemon-assets/img/trainers-profile`, which will automatically set the actor's Prototype Token to use the associated spritesheet.

***Method 2.*** **Manual Setting.** The trainer overworld sprites are located in `modules/pokemon-assets/img/trainers-overworld`; the Pokemon ones are in `modules/pokemon-assets/img/pmd-overworld` (but the Pokemon sprites should get automatically set for PTR and PTR2e)


### Token Following

1. **Follow Target**: Hover over the target token and press `F`.
2. **Move Target**: Move the leader token to see the following token move accordingly. Moving a token manually that's following another token will break the follow.
3. **Combat Mode**: Tokens **do not** follow if there is an active combat on the current scene.

### Interacting with Rocks/Trees/Signs/etc

To interact with an already placed object, select your character's token, move it up to the object (be sure it's facing the object) and press `Enter`. This should trigger whatever behavior is defined for that tile/region.

For "Field Moves" like *Rock Smash*, *Cut*, and so on, the selected character needs to be assigned the relevant move, or be the owner of a party which contains a character assigned those moves.

### Interactable Tiles

Select the tool on the Tile layer and double-click the spot you want to place the tile. Click-and-drag functionality will be added in a future update.

### Region Tools

On the Regions layer, while editing a region, you can add new behaviors as defined in this module. To add, click the `Behaviors` tab, and then click the `üß© (Puzzle Piece)` icon. This should bring up a wizard to run you through, step-by-step, adding the following features: Sliding Ice, One-Way-Jumps, "Eyes Meeting", Pokemon Centers & Computers

## Troubleshooting

- **Token Size Issues**: If tokens don't resize correctly, try refreshing the page. Token resizing via active effect in PTR2e is a known bug that I haven't been able to figure out yet.
